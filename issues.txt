Are the argument defaults apparent in the help files?

some NOTES remain when you run check 
one of the remaining notes that occurs when you run check, namely to add dependencies to the description. I did this throug roxygen2, but have not rerun check to see if it worked to check's satisfaction. At the same time all external functions identified by check are now called using ::, so I hope dependencies are now identified and check should not complain but need to check

In mmsvarwts Jon used mms:::transmn to call the internal function transmn. Should we be doing this uniformly to call internal (:::) and external (::) functions in this and other packages whenever we call such functions? I got rid of the ::: because running check taught me that you do not need to use ::: for functions (internal or external) within the same package. Also, CRAN apparently does not allow :::

Do we have sufficient references in our documentation? Should refer to all our own relevant papers as well as perhaps some other general papers/books about matrix regression, as well as perhaps the ecodist package

finish the vignette

Here is how you install the package currently, with vignettes, and look at the vignette as it presumably will appear in the package:
library(devtools)
install_github("reumandc/mms",build_vignettes=TRUE)
library(mms)
browseVignettes("mms")
#then click on html

If this does not work, I have found the process can be fragile and you can try:
detaching the package (unclick it under the packages tab in R studio)
uninstalling the package (can also do this in the same tab)
restart Rstudio
try the above installation steps again
