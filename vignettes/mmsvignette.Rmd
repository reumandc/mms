<!--Thoughts on what should maybe be included:
Brief qualitative intro to matrix model selection, with references
Reference to Jon's paper, and Tom's Oikos and L&O (hopefully) papers
I would ike to have an example using real data, Jon's gypsy moth or Tom's Oikos would be good, but need something where the 
  data (or a suitable subset) can be included, and it also needs to run reasonably fast
Basically we describe the method (copy from the section in supp mat in Ecol Lett, basically)
We also will have to intro the data
Mention the likelihood methods, cite the relevant papers, say the contexts where those wont work
Show the use of all the functions that the user needs on the data
-->

# Brief introduction to matrix regression


# Example data


# Model selection on matrix models and the package functions
<!--This includes:
How to call the functions, how to interpret results - done on the example data, simultaneous description of how to use the functions and how   to interpret the stats
Brief statement on why the usual AIC methods wont work here
Brief statement on the likelihood methods that exist (REFS) and why they wont work here
-->

# Details of the method
<!--Much like the suppmat section of Jon's Ecol Lett paper that is about these methods -->

# Simulation study of effectiveness
<!-- Not sure what this will be or even if it will remain. Could be a paired down version of the model-based proof of effeciveness
of the method that is in Jon's Ecol Lett paper, or could be that whole thing reproduced (but watch run times) or could just be a 
summary of the results that appear there and a citation-->
