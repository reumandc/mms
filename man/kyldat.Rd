\description{
Plankton and environmental measurements from a long term monitoring project on Kentucky
Lake, Kentucky, USA.
These are data analyzed by Anderson et al. (Oikos, 127, 403-414, 2017) and stored in Dryad
by the same authors (Dryad Digital Repository, https://doi.org/10.5061/dryad.21jt3, 2017), provided
here with no alteration.
Data are annual averages from 16 lake locations from 1990-2015.
