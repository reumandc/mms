#' Data from geography of synchrony simulation experiment. 
#' This is Mechanism A in Walter et al. (2017), in which geography of synchrony arises from 
#' the spatial structure of an environmental driver.
#' See Walter et al. (2017) or the accompanying vignette for model and parameterization details.

#' @format A list containing four locations x time steps matrices: 
#' \code{pop} gives population time series for 16 locations.
#' \code{driver} gives time series for the operating environmental driver.
#' \code{latent} gives time series for the latent environmental driver.
#' \code{dispersal} gives the locations x locations dispersal matrix.

#' Data from Kentucky Lake
#' 
#' Plankton and environmental measurements from a long term monitoring project on Kentucky
#' Lake, Kentucky, USA.
#' These are data analyzed by Anderson et al. (Oikos, 127, 403-414, 2017) and stored in Dryad
#' by the same authors (Dryad Digital Repository, https://doi.org/10.5061/dryad.21jt3, 2017), provided
#' here with no alteration.
#' Data are annual averages from 16 lake locations from 1990-2015. 
#' The original, pre-annualization data can be requested at http://www.murraystate.edu/wsi/wsi_database.aspx.

#' Qualitatively estimated dispersal difficulty matrix for Kentucky Lake
#' 
#' This matrix was created and analyzed by Anderson et al. (Oikos, 127, 403-414, 2017) and was provided
#' in the supporting information of that paper. It is reproduced here with no alteration.
#' The matrix represents qualitative estimates of the difficulty of plankton dispersal between all pairs
#' of sampling locations, with larger numbers meaning more difficult dispersal.
#' Estimates were based on knowledge of large-scale water movement patterns in the lake.
