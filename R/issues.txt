Are the argument defaults apparent in the help files?

Did mmsmodwts break? I (Jon) get an error seemingly from mmsmodwts when I try to run tests on mmsvarwts. 
  DAN says on morning 2018 04 19: possibly, I have not written tests for mmsmodwts yet. But tests for varwts 
  should not rely on modwts to pass/fail, they should be tests only of varwts, so I am going to work on chaging that now
  
  DAN says on afternoon of 2018 04 19: I did not end up changing the test for varwts, I left that for Jon, I just commented
  out the current test. The reason is, when chasing down the reason that test failed, I found a larger semi-issue. The issue
  is, none of the functions work for n=1. They are not supposed to. The functions are based on comparisons between locations,
  and out-of-sample accuracy is judged based on ability to predict comparisons between omitted locations. But when only one
  location is omitted, there are no *comparisons* between omitted locations. Recall that self comparisons are always discarded.
  So I changed the error check for n (down in the cleaning function) to require n>=2. I added unit tests for this new 
  functionality, too. In the process of the above I wrote a unit tests for mmsmodwts, and all current unit tests passed (not
  counting the one for mmsvarwts that Jon wrote, which I commented out). So not all functions except mmsvarwts are passing 
  at least one test, which means the way *should* be clear for Jon to put in a test for mmsvarwts, though, Jon, you will
  have to change you test to use n>1.
